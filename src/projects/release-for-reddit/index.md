A GitHub Action to automate submitting a release post on Reddit. This was my second submission for [GitHub Hackathon](https://githubhackathon.com/).

## What I've Learned

After the first submission for [Substitute String](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/substitute-string), I wanted to do something more useful. This action gave me the opportunity to work with external APIs which includes authentication, authorization and calling endpoints.

I had some trouble with Reddit's API which oddly doesn't work with my main account. I had to create a new account which surprisingly worked straight away. New accounts are throttled when submitting posts or comments so it was also great chance for me to handle the custom timeout response.
