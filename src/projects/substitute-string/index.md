A GitHub Action to easily substitute strings using YAML. This was my first submission for [GitHub Hackathon](https://githubhackathon.com/).

## What I've Learned

I had previous experience with GitHub Actions by helping with prebuilt binaries in [node-argon2](https://github.com/ranisalt/node-argon2/pull/242), but building an action from scratch gave me a great insight on GitHub's approach to CI/CD, which is highly flexible and extensible compared to other solutions.
